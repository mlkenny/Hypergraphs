# Project Details
This project delves into the creation of a Hypergraph: an n-set that satifies the Sidon set condition and the square power condition.
At this given moment there have only been 2 examples of a hypergraph of girth 6.
The ultimate goal is to reach a general formula for a hypergraph of size n; Current goal is to find a hypergraph of girth 7.
# Project Goals
    1. Recreate functional hypergraph example sets of girth 3 and 4.
    2. Attempt to find more example sets of girth 5.
    3. If applicable, attempt to find more example sets of girth 6.
